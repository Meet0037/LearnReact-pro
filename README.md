Intro to JSX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
1. What is JSX?
----------------
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does “syntax extension” mean?

In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can’t read it!

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

------------------
2. JSX Elements
------------------
A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

Here’s an example of a JSX element:

----------------------
<h1>Hello world</h1>
----------------------

This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.
